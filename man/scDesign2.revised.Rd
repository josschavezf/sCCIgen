\title{Simulate a count matrix for a single cell type}
\usage{
scDesign2.revised(
  model_params,
  n_cell_new,
  cell_type_prop,
  depth_simu_ref_ratio = NULL,
  sim_method = c("copula", "ind")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_params}{A list with the same length as \code{cell_type_prop} that contains
the fitted model as each of its element (can be either the copula
model or the (w/o copula) model).}

\item{n_cell_new}{The total number of cells in the simulated count matrix.}

\item{cell_type_prop}{The cell type proportion in the simulated count matrix.}

\item{depth_simu_ref_ratio}{The (expected) sequencing depth ratio between simulated and refernece data.}

\item{sim_method}{Simulation method. Simulate genes independently 'ind' or considering
their correlations ('copula').}
}
\value{
A matrix of shape p by n that contains the simulated count values. p is derived from
\code{model_params}.
}
\description{
Revise the initial scDesign2 functions to allow different sequencing depth
}
